you have to done nothing else than that to start with your new test for printf ! Of course this test is at its first version and I hope to continue enforcing
the rules and make it more dynamic. In the meantime
```C
    cd root_project/ft_printf_tester
    make    // or make re, depending on the version
    make controller
```
